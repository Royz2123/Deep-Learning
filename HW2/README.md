**NOTE: For users interested in multi-GPU, we recommend looking at the newer [cifar10_estimator](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/tutorials/image/cifar10_estimator) example instead.**

CIFAR-10 is a common benchmark in machine learning for image recognition.

We reduced the number of parameters to 85K and still reached a 78% accuracy

```
python cifar10_train.py
```
